## How to use our website
1. Talk to the administrator/teacher in charge of the SU, and ask him/her to email you a code so that you can register on the website.
2. Register an account on the website. If you are a club, then you will need to enter in your club information.
If you are an admin, then you don't need to enter any club information.
3. Login. You will see a calendar on the homepage. Clubs can click on any date that is not red. Red means that you can't reserve
a room on that date. Clubs can only reserve rooms within two weeks of the current day and only on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors.
4. Once you have selected a room to reserve, go to My Rooms to see the rooms you have reserved for the club.
5. You can click unreserve to unreserve the room.
6. For the administrator/teacher in charge of the SU (aka Mr. Polazzo), you can block rooms from being reserved on certain days.
You can also reserve rooms for yourself, and you can approve clubs to create accounts on the reservation website.
Just go to the Approve Clubs page, and fill out the form. There will be an automated email sent to the club's email.
7. Any user can see the archive, which is a list of reserved and blocked rooms currently and previously.
8. See the room schedule page and click on any date to see a list of clubs who reserved rooms on that date.
9. Go to the settings page to change the password for the account.
